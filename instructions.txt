Basics of git:

Projects you'd like to maintain using git are stored inside directories called git repositories, which contain hidden folders that git
uses to keep track of your project and changes to it.

Creating a git repository:
1) Use git bash inside the directory you'd like to create a repository of.
2) Use the command: git init

This will create a git repository inside that folder/directory.

Your first git commit: -- 

Git uses a "snapshot" model to keep track of the changes you've made to your project.
When making changes to files, you need to "stage them" (add them) as content that you would like git to add to your next snapshot (commit)

To stage/add files that you would like to commit, use one of the following commands

1) git add <filename>
	OR if you would like to add every file inside the directory,
2) git add *

To finalize this commit / take a snapshot of your "staged"/added content

git commit -m "My first commit"

To put your content on github, first we need to make a remote repository on github where a non-local copy of your repository will be stored.
Once you have this remote repository made, we are going to "push" your content to this remote repository

git remote add origin <link to git repo>
git push origin master
